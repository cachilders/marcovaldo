# Development Patterns and Principles for This Project

This document provides key resources, best practices, and lessons learned from past development experiences to guide future work on this project.

## Key Resources

### Norns API Reference
- The Norns API provides a comprehensive guide to the executing environment. Familiarity with this API is essential for effective development.
- Access the official Norns API documentation here: [Norns API Reference](https://monome.org/docs/norns/reference/)

## Key Development Principles

### 1. Maintain Proper Inheritance and Object Hierarchy
- **Why:** Subverting inheritance structures can lead to bugs and unnecessary complexity.
- **How:** 
  - Follow established patterns for object creation and extension.
  - Use `setmetatable` correctly to ensure proper delegation of behavior.
  - Avoid introducing breaking changes to base classes or modules without a clear and documented rationale.

---

### 2. Prioritize State Management
- **Why:** Poor state handling can result in unpredictable behavior and hard-to-diagnose bugs.
- **How:** 
  - Clearly define state variables and their expected transitions.
  - Reset flags and states (e.g., `halt_keys`, `keys_held`) at appropriate points in the lifecycle.
  - Write unit tests to validate state transitions under different scenarios.

---

### 3. Diagnostic Logging
- **Purpose:** Diagnostic logs (e.g., `print` statements) are for development only and MUST be deleted before release.
- **Why:** 
  - Norns is a constrained system - all logs must be removed for production.
  - Logs in production environments may expose sensitive information.
- **How:**
  - Use `print` statements during development as needed.
  - Delete ALL logs before release.
  - Test thoroughly after log removal.

---

### 4. Debugging and Logging
- **Why:** Meaningful logs help detect and resolve issues efficiently during development and testing.
- **How:** 
  - Use descriptive and consistent log messages (e.g., "Added key to held keys").
  - Log both success and failure cases to provide context for debugging.
  - Ensure logs provide actionable information without cluttering the output.

---

### 5. Modular and Scalable Design
- **Why:** Modular design improves code reuse and ease of maintenance.
- **How:** 
  - Isolate functionality into self-contained modules or classes (e.g., `SheetPane`, `SequenceSheet`).
  - Design modules to handle different configurations (e.g., 64-key vs. 128-key grids) through options or parameters.
  - Avoid hardcoding values; use constants and configuration variables instead.

---

### 6. Gesture and Event Handling
- **Why:** Complex gestures require robust detection and handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **How:** 
  - Validate all conditions for triggering gestures (e.g., specific keys being held simultaneously).
  - Provide clear feedback mechanisms for successful or unsuccessful gestures.
  - Implement fallback mechanisms to handle edge cases gracefully.

---

### 7. Collaborative Development Practices
- **Why:** Collaboration reduces errors and improves code quality.
- **How:** 
  - Conduct code reviews to validate adherence to principles and patterns.
  - Document changes thoroughly, including the rationale behind decisions.
  - Use version control effectively to track changes and facilitate collaboration.

## Recommendations for Future Development

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Regularly review and refactor code to align with evolving best practices.
  - Learn from past issues and incorporate lessons into future development.
